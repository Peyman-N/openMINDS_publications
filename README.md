# openMINDS_publications

The **openMINDS_publications** repository is part of the **open** **M**etadata **I**nitiative for **N**euroscience **D**ata Structures (**openMINDS**). It extends openMINDS, by providing metadata schemas for representing publications in neuroscience, including interactive publications such as Live Papers. It includes schemas for articles, books, preprints, blog posts, live papers, etc., linked to other openMINDS entities such as Datasets. The schemas closely follow those in Schema.org but extend them for improved interoperability with openMINDS.

For more information please go to the [main openMINDS repository](https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/openMINDS).
